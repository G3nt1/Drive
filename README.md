# Django File Management System


## Introduction

This Django-based File Management System allows users to organize their files and folders efficiently. It provides features such as:

- User authentication and authorization
- Organizing files into folders
- Sharing files and folders with other users
- Extracting and displaying file metadata
- Thumbnail generation for images
- User preferences for viewing and theming

## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization

- Role-based authorization ensures that users only have access to their own files and folders.

### File and Folder Organization

- Users can create folders and organize their files within them.
- Folders can be marked as important or deleted as needed.

### Sharing

- Users can share files and folders with other users.
- Shared items are easy to manage, and users can accept or reject shared items.

### Metadata Extraction

- The system extracts metadata from image files, including image size, file size, date taken, and location (if available).
- Metadata is displayed alongside the file, providing valuable information.

### Thumbnail Generation

- Image files have thumbnails generated for easy previewing.

### User Preferences

- Users can customize their experience with view mode (icon or table) and theme mode (light or dark).
